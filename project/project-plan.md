# Project Plan

## Title

Comparative Analysis of Causes of Death

## Main Question

1. What are the leading causes of death, and how do they vary by different demographics and over time?

## Description

Understanding the primary causes of mortality is crucial for public health planning and prevention strategies. This project aims to analyze various factors leading to death, utilizing datasets that detail the number of deaths by different causes over specific periods. By examining data on demographics such as age, gender, and ethnicity, the study will identify key trends and differences in mortality rates. The insights gained could inform public health policies and interventions aimed at reducing mortality rates, thereby potentially extending life expectancy. The analysis will be conducted using statistical methods to ensure robust and actionable results.

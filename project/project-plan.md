## Title

Impact of Climate Change: Analysis of Global Carbon Dioxide Levels and Surface Temperature Changes

## Main Question

1. How has climate change influenced global carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and surface temperature changes over time?
   
## Description

This project investigates the impact of climate change on global carbon dioxide levels and surface temperature changes, aiming to explain their interconnected dynamics. Using datasets on World Monthly Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Concentrations and Annual Surface Temperature Change, the study explores temporal trends and potential correlations between these critical climate indicators. By employing advanced statistical techniques, the analysis seeks to uncover patterns, anomalies, and potential causal links influenced by climate change. Insights gleaned from this investigation could contribute to a deeper understanding of climate change's effects on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and surface temperature changes, informing policy-making efforts aimed at mitigating its adverse impacts.
